# Simple With Name

This theme demonstates adding a Markdown file for controlling site 
navigation and document specific titles. Like the simple theme you have 
a Content element and a sitewide common CSSPath element.

The title element in the Markdown document is extracted with the _mkpage_ 
utility called _titleline_.  

This theme relies on three _mkpage_ project commands - _mkpage_, 
_reldocpath_, _titleline_` and _ws_ (for testing the website and viewing 
from your web browser over http://localhost:8000)

To test this theme do the following run the following commands in this 
directory.

```shell
    ./mk-website.bash
    ws
```

Point your webbrowser at http://localhost:8000 and view this page.

## Improvements over one-element

+ The Title is generated from extracting it from the Markdown document being processed.
+ Navigation is defined in _nav.md_ for the site. This is generated by collection document URLs and relative paths using standard Unix shell commands
+ CSSPath is calculated, as before, with _reldocpath_
+ [mk-website.bash](mk-website.bash) will find all Markdown files and subdirectories and render _nav.md_ automatically


## Limitations

1. This theme assumes this directory is the root HTML directory
2. _nav.md_ is treated as a special filename and not rendered as its own page
3. Navigation is defined as a UL list and always expanded but this could be improved with updating the CSS pointed to by CSSPath
