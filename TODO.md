## Bugs

+ [ ] mkpage front matter based on library metadata practices, codemeta.json and relavant Scheme.org scheme
    + [ ] `.doi` the DOI associated with a page

## Someday, Maybe

+ [ ] mkpage slide support for remarkjs
    + See https://github.com/gnab/remark, https://remarkjs.com and https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki
