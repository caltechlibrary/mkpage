# Ideas and questions

+ Add JSON decoding for text strings as well as local files
+ Could one key/value pair on the command line be expanded be the next key/value pair?
    + {{datetime}} key gets replace by {{date}}, {{time}} and those get response by their respective keys and values?
+ I need a recipe book for leveraging Go's text/template package's DSL, most examples assume you're building a go program first, templates second
