# Ideas and questions

+ If you can pull in JSON data sources how to you map their content?
+ Google templates and their nuances are hard to explain, missing good tutorials (the best in the context of Hugo which is an extended implementation)
+ Does it make sense to just use mustache style value replacement? What about missing values?
+ Could one key/value pair on the command line be expanded be the next key/value pair?
    + {{datetime}} key gets replace by {{date}}, {{time}} and those get response by their respective keys and values?
