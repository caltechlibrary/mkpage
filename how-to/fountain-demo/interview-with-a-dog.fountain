I need work on my dachshund communicaiton skills, I am afraid I didn't understand you.

DODGER

Bark, bark, whine, woof

ROBERT

Well this probably is silly, but I needed to interview someone.

DODGER

Sign, woof, bark

ROBERT

I understand that, we don't speak the same language, we're not the same species but look, I needed to interview someone. How about a treat?
