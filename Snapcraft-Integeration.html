Snapcraft integration
</h1>
<p>
After the v1.0 release of MkPage Project I’ve started experimenting with
creating snaps. The snap model of a secure container for execution is
attractive though how this limits the applications behaviors is very
constraining. A minor hurdle was overcome with v1.0.3 release where I
think I have a way to install a Pandoc along side MkPage so that my
<code>mkpage</code> command can render content via Pandoc and it’s
template engine. This comes at a cost. The snap installation is larger
(and suitable Pandoc may already be on the system). It also means the
snap does not support all the platforms of that are build via snapcraft
because the Conda/Pandoc combo isn’t available (e.g. s390x). As a result
I think the snap has to remain “experimental”.
</p>
<p>
Another challenge of the snap is MkPage as a project include many
command line tools. Only the <code>mkpage</code> command is
automatically aliased. In the snap model to avoid name collisions the
<code>mkpage</code> command is action
<code>/snap/bin/mkpage.mkpage</code> alaised as <code>mkpage</code>. But
the other commands don’t get automagically aliased. That means if you
want to use <code>frontmatter</code> or <code>mkrss</code> it they need
to have additional <code>snap alias</code> commands run to work. Since
the appeal of snap is easy install across Linux distributions this is a
problem. The snap simply is not “easy” in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
One of the trends I’ve seen in Unix/POSIX command line tools is a shift
away from “flags” to bare words. A particularly common model seen in
tools like <code>git</code> or <code>go</code> is a <code>APP_NAME VERB
OBJECT_PARAMETERS</code> syntax model. If you think of the
<code>APP_NAME VERB</code> as a dot pair this is an echo of Oberon
Operating System’s dot pairs for procedure commands. In the case of
snaps this is evern more so because of the approach taken to namespace a
snap. Since Go binary tend to be large adopting this model would improve
the disk storage foot print of the MkPage project as well as remove one
of the current problems in the snap package process. This would require
changes to how dependencies of mkpage and would encourage some code
modernization.
</p>
<p>
While I suspect the snapcraft.yaml’s layout section may solve distrution
of manpages and default templates I haven’t had time to experiment with
it. The current set of pages in the documentation directory should be
reformat to allow production of man pages as well as general MkPage
documentation, but doing so would need to be integrated easily into the
snap build and deployment process.
