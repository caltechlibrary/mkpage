Convert a Markdown file into a sequence of HTML5 slides.

+ Use Markdown to write your presentation in one file
+ Separate slides by "--" and a new line (e.g. \n versus \r\n)
+ Apply the simple default template or use your own
+ Control Layout and display with HTML5 and CSS

If you save this [file](example/presentation.md) as presentation.md it would
generate the following webpages

+ [00-presentation01.html](example/00-presentation.html)
+ [01-presentation02.html](example/01-presentation.html)
+ [02-presentation03.html](example/02-presentation.html)
