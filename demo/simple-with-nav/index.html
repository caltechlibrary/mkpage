    <section><h1>Simple With Navigation</h1>

<p>This theme demonstates adding a Markdown file for controlling site
navigation and document specific titles. Like the simple theme you have
a Content element and a sitewide common CSSPath element.</p>

<p>The title element in the Markdown document is extracted with the <em>mkpage</em>
utility called <em>titleline</em>.</p>

<p>This theme relies on three <em>mkpage</em> project commands - <em>mkpage</em>,
<em>reldocpath</em>, <em>titleline</em>` and <em>ws</em> (for testing the website and viewing
from your web browser over <a href="http://localhost:8000)">http://localhost:8000)</a></p>

<p>To test this theme do the following run the following commands in this
directory.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">    ./mk-website.bash
    ws
</code></pre>

<p>Point your webbrowser at <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a> and view this page.</p>

<h2>Improvements over one-element</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Title is generated from extracting it from the Markdown document being processed.</li>
<li>Navigation is defined in <em>nav.md</em> for the site. This is generated by collection document URLs and relative paths using standard Unix shell commands</li>
<li>CSSPath is calculated, as before, with <em>reldocpath</em></li>
<li><a href="mk-website.bash">mk-website.bash</a> will find all Markdown files and subdirectories and render <em>nav.md</em> automatically</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ol>
<li>This theme assumes this directory is the root HTML directory</li>
<li><em>nav.md</em> is treated as a special filename and not rendered as its own page</li>
<li>Navigation is defined as a UL list and always expanded but this could be improved with updating the CSS pointed to by CSSPath</li>
</ol>
