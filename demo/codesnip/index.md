# codesnip demo

In this demo code will be presented in code blocks with
an extra annotation to indicate the filename it belongs to.

Here is an example --

```shell
    #!/bin/bash

    echo "Hello World!"
```

Processing by mkpage yields the markdown you'd expect.
Processing with codesnip yields a file called hello.bash.
