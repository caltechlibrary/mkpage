<h1>
Pandoc intergation with MkPage
</h1>
<h2>
A future for MkPage
</h2>
<p>
This is a distillation of my thinking about Markdown processors and <strong>mkpage</strong> as static website generator. I am excited about the current state of <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> because of Mike Hucka’s <a href="https://github.com/mhucka/pangolin-notebook">Pangolin</a>.
</p>
<h2>
What’s Pandoc?
</h2>
<p>
Pandoc is a document conversion tool. It converts to and from a ridiculous number of formats. In addition to HTML it includes output formats I want to use in the near future like ePub2, ePub3, PDF. Pandoc has excellent support Mathematical text. Pandoc is <a href="https://rstudio.com/">R Studio</a>’s Markdown to HTML engine. This is important as that means people who use R Studio to create web content will know Pandoc’s dialect of Markdown even if they don’t know they are using Pandoc. Pandoc can be extended using <a href="https://lua.org">Lua</a>. Pandoc itself is written in <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> which is an interesting language.
</p>
<p>
On a selfish note, Pandoc supports the features of Markdown I regularly use, code blocks, tables and foot/end notes and Pandoc will convert from Markdown to Jira/Confluence’s flavor of markup.
</p>
<h3>
So why talk up Pandoc?
</h3>
<p>
Based on Mike’s Pangolin my thinking around Pandoc has evolved. There is Pandoc the document converter but there is also Pandoc the template engine.
</p>
<p>
Pandoc as a template engine is intriguing. I was able to read and understand Mike’s templates without resorting to documentation. More importantly <strong>Pandoc has good documentation</strong>, including their simple template language! This holds promise for future proofing our site generation with <strong>mkpage</strong>.
</p>
<h3>
mkpage’s failure
</h3>
<p>
A huge glaring failure in my <code>mkpage</code> project has been my reliance on Go’s native template language. It was a good bootstrap but not so fun now[^now]. While Go’s template language is “enterprise” ready[^ready] Go’s template language remains poorly documented. Go’s template language has little outside adoption aside from Hugo[^Hugo]. This situation has not improved in the last decade and I think is unlikely to improve. Go’s various Markdown to HTML libraries have caused concerns. Like what I observed in the NodeJS community many Go packages fail to be updated with version changes and have become orphaned projects. My concern is that overtime 3rd Party Go packages I’ve relied on will loose development inertia and be abandoned. I am on my third Markdown library in Go at this stage of <code>mkpage</code>. Maybe it’s time to step off the tread mill?
